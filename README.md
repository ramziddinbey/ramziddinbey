<H2> Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm RamziddinðŸ˜‰. My friends call me ChiccoðŸ˜„ </H2>
  
I am Java and Kotlin Backend Developer and freelance software engineer from Uzbekistan. My passion for software is dreaming up ideas and realizing them with elegant interfaces. I care deeply about the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I am also an open source enthusiast and servant. I have learned a lot from the open source community and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happen through open source.
